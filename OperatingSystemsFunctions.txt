Windows OS Security is among the best and worst security when it comes to user friendly security.
Because of the nature of programs for windows, it can be very easy to get a virus when downloading files.
While there is a built in firewall and virus scanning, it often has to be a bit overzealous when looking at unknown files.
This can lead to frustration as perfectly safe files get flagged for quarentine by the security system.
